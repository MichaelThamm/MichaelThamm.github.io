## We Are uWinLoop

3 years into university I found a team of inspired engineering students studying at University of Windsor, ON, Canada. As an electrical & computer engineering student, I was excited to connect with and learn from fellow engineering students from various other departments. We had a common goal; to qualify for the SpaceX-Hyperloop competition in California, USA and meet Elon Musk (the founder of the competition).

### Journey To Top 51

Many countless working hours passed by which led to the rise of a **magnetic levitation propulsion system**, technically named Double Sided Linear Induction Motor (boring). Leading this team and working alongside other likeminded, junior engineers enabled us to convince the competition admins that our design had potential, granting the team access to the **top 51** ranking and one step closer to our goal.

## Journey To MaSc

While competition was exhilirating and we put our city on the map, I was hungry for more. The rules state that each team member must be a student of a registered university. Realizing that I may never meet my idol again, the inevitibility of persuing a masters degree in magnetic induction propulsion systems was apparent. As I am now 1.5 years into my masters and counting, I sit at my desk waiting for the pandemic to ease and Elon to announce competition again. The true potential of a **genetically optimized induction motor hybrid modelling** software written in Python has yet to be experienced by uWinLoop's competitors as we cruise into the opportunity to meet Elon once again

## What Is Automated Construction?

**“We at Brave are committed to continue to work with our partners and offer innovative solutions through automation”. [1]**

**"...it means a lot to all the parties involved that had the courage to try to do something that nobody else in the industry has done before”. [1]**

This is a common theme at Brave where it is our company culture to explore the depths of innovation. Construction proved to be a market that was hungry for automated solutions, already widely adapted in the automotive industry. Being a highly labour intensive industry that requires much human interaction due to the variability between the design and assembly of build, a solution can be hard to achieve. Ready to embrace the chaos, our team of engineers set out to **do something that nobody else in the industry has done before**.

## ABB-RobotStudio v2021 & Siemens TIA Portal v15.1

The foundation of a successful project is its programming and this project harmonized the robot world and PLC domain. With the PLC acting as the brains of the operation, accounting for the machine's spatial awareness, allows it to puppeteer its robot army to assemble and weld the chassis one building block at a time
