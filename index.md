  ### What Is Automated Construction?

  [LinkedIn Project Summary](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brave-control-solutions_transforming-the-construction-industry-abb-activity-6811664821377998848-r5mn)

  **“We at Brave are committed to continue to work with our partners and offer innovative solutions through automation”. [1]**

  **"...it means a lot to all the parties involved that had the courage to try to do something that nobody else in the industry has done before”. [1]**

  This is a common theme at Brave where it is our company culture to explore the depths of innovation. Construction proved to be a market that was hungry for automated solutions, already widely adapted in the automotive industry. Being a highly labour intensive industry that requires much human interaction due to the variability between the design and assembly of builds, a solution can be hard to achieve. Ready to embrace the chaos, our team of engineers set out to **do something that nobody else in the industry has done before**.

  ### ABB-RobotStudio v2021 & Siemens TIA Portal v15.1

  The foundation of a successful project is its programming and this project harmonized the robot world and PLC domain. With the PLC acting as the brains of the operation, accounting for the machine's spatial awareness, it puppeteers its robot army to assemble and weld the chassis one building block at a time. I was responsible for **programming functions that contributes to the orginization, cyclic function call**. This project even required me to **teach ABB robots while elevated on mobile elevated work platform (MEWP) 20' in the air**.

  ### FARO BuildIT Metrology v2021

  Due to the nature of construction at scale there was an apparent need for GD&T (dimensioning and tolerance). A machine that is required to automate the process of producing room-sized lego blocks must do so accurately. The machine tolerance was set at **+-1/4 mm across 20 m** which is where the FARO laser ARM and BuildIT Metrology software applied. This part of the project was piloted by yours truly.

  ## Charge Labs [Website Link](https://chargelabs.ca/)

  _"The CHARGE Lab, under the leadership of its founder Professor Narayan C. Kar, who is a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Electrified Vehicles, is an internationally recognized R&D, component and system design and test centre that fosters cross-disciplinary research collaboration among materials, mechanical, electrical and software engineers."_

  I am an active member of the research team at Charge Labs, pushing the envelope of EV research. My work includes evolutionairy algorithms, induction motor design, and motor performance testing. My contributions can be found here:

  ### Journey To MaSc [Repo Link](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/MaSc-LinearInductionMotorGeneticOptimization)

  _Due to intellectual property I cannot share the full contents of my program. However, I still want to highlight my coding ability produced in this project so a repo link for the project can be found at the header._

  The true potential of a **genetically optimized induction motor hybrid modelling software** written in **Python** has yet to be experienced in the motor research community.

  ## We Are uWinLoop [Website Link](https://www.uwinloop.ca/)

  3 years into university I found a team of inspired engineering students studying at University of Windsor, ON, Canada. As an electrical & computer engineering student, I was excited to connect with fellow students from various departments. We had a common goal; to qualify for the **SpaceX-Hyperloop** competition in LA, California and meet **Elon Musk** (the founder of the competition).

  ### Journey To Top 51

  Many countless working hours passed by which led to the rise of a **magnetic levitation propulsion system**, technically named Double Sided Linear Induction Motor. Leading this team and working alongside other likeminded, junior engineers enabled us to convince the competition admins that our design had potential, granting the team access to the top 51 ranking and one step closer to our goal.

  ### Journey To Top 21

  Top 51 required us to submit a preliminary design briefing (PDB) and now it was time to produce a final design package (FDP). The FDP included experimental results and simulations from subsytems such as:

  * Shell
  * Frame
  * Batteries
  * Propulsion
  * Control System
  * Inverter
  * Suspension
  * Braking 

  [FDP Link](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/SpaceX-HyperloopCompetition/blob/gh-pages/FDP.pdf)

  The final step before acceptance into the top 21 required a 2 hour interview/presentation with **SpaceX engineers**. The team was building confidence and it was becoming clear that we were no longer just a small-town, first year team.

  ## California

  LA, California provided 2 weeks of stress while grinding out hours in our AirBnB, working on last minute pod fixes. I am truly grateful to share this competition with teams across the world that travelled from **India, Germany, Canada, USA, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands** to name a few. We did not place top 5 but we got to shake hands with Elon Musk and that is something I am truly grateful for.
